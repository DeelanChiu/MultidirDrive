# MultidirDrive
This is an independent project I conducted as the Chief Software Devloper of my FRC robotics team when I was a senior in High School.
The main source file is src\org\usfirst\frc\team4253\robot\FODrive, whereas the rest of the files are source codes for operating the rest of the robot.
In essence, it is a program that sets the robot to a certain coordinate of movement relative to the robot driver regardless of which way the robot is facing.
THe program uses gyroscope data to orient the robot as well as input from the driver via joystick for movement.
